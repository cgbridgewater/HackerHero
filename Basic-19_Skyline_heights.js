// Lovely Burbank has a breathtaking view of the Los Angeles skyline. Letâ€™s say you are given an array with heights of consecutive buildings, starting closest to you and extending away. Array [-1,7,3] would represent three buildings: first is actually out of view below street level, behind it is second at 7 stories high, third is 3 stories high (hidden behind the 7-story). You are situated at street level. Return array containing heights of buildings you can see, in order. Given [-1,1,1,7,3] return [1,7]. Given [0,4] return [4]. As always with challenges, do not use built-in array functions such as unshift().

function heights(arr){
    // Enter code below
    newArr = []
    temp = 0
    for (i = 0; i<arr.length; i++){
        if(i == 0 && arr[i]>0){
            newArr.push(arr[i])
            temp = arr[i]
        }
        if (arr[i] > 0){
                //check for higher than prev.
                if(arr[i] > temp){
                newArr.push(arr[i])  
                temp = arr[i]
                }
        }
    }
    return newArr
}


console.log(heights( [-1, 1, 1, 7, 3] ));
heights( [-1, 1, 1, 7, 3] ) //to return [1,7]
heights( [0, 4] ) //to return [4]
heights( [-1, 1, 1, 7, 3, 5, 9] ) //to return [1,7,9]
heights( [-1, 1, 1, 7, 3, 5, 9, -3, 3, 15] ) //to return [1,7,9,15]
